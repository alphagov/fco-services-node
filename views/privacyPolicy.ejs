                    <span class="number">2. </span>What data we process and why</h2>

                <p>The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) works in the UK and overseas to protect our people, to project our influence and values and to promote our prosperity overseas. In doing so we process personal data.</p>

                <p>British Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates process personal data for the purposes of providing British nationals with notarial and documentary services abroad, for processing Emergency Travel Documents (ETD) and for the payment of those services.</p>

                <p>We also process data for the purpose of providing the consular assistance described in our publication <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-british-nationals-abroad-a-guide">Support for British nationals abroad: a guide</a>. If you are seeking consular assistance, your data will be used by our staff in the UK and overseas to assess your individual circumstances to determine what help you require. In some countries where British nationals are at risk they are invited to provide their details to us in order that they can be contacted in an emergency and assistance provided.</p>

                <p>Where you have been provided with consular assistance, your data will be recorded on our internal case management system, Casebook. Data processed for the purposes of Consular Marriages, Consular Civil Partnerships, Consular Conversions of Civil Partnership to Marriage services and Birth and Death registrations also becomes part of the UK public record.</p>

                <p>In order to use fee-paying services online, you will need to enter personal information. Such information includes your name, contact details, date of birth, and in some cases you will be asked to provide details of certain documents. We use this information to confirm an appointment and provide the service requested, as well as to process the payment, identify who is paying and to send email receipts. Credit card data is processed by our supplier, <a href="https://www.barclaycard.co.uk/business/accepting-payments/corporate-payment-solutions/online">Barclaycard</a>.</p>

                <p>Some of the services we provide online may contain free-text fields in which you are invited to enter additional comments relating to the selected service. You should not enter details of medical history, religious beliefs and financial information or any other sensitive information into these free-text fields.</p>

                    <span class="number">3. </span>Processing of website usage information and web queries</h2>

                <p>Separately from the information entered by those using our online service, we also collect website usage information, which allows us to see how the service is being used. This information includes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>questions, queries or feedback you leave, including your email address if you send a message via feedback</li>
                    <li>your IP address, and details of which version of web browser you used. IP addresses are anonymised to two bytes e.g. 192.168.xxx.xxx</li>
                    <li>information about how you use the site, using cookies and page tagging techniques to help us improve the website</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This helps us to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>improve the site by monitoring how you use it</li>
                    <li>respond to any feedback you send us, if you’ve asked us to provide you with information about local services</li>
                </ul>

                    <span class="number">3.1 </span>Data provided in times of crisis directly or by third parties</h3>

                <p>In most cases, you will have provided the data we hold. However, in some cases it may have been provided by a family member or friend calling us for advice or support. During times of crisis, we may have taken the decision not to highlight our privacy notice to you/the third party, due to the urgency of the situation.</p>

                <p>However we will provide a link to this Privacy Notice within our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">Travel Advice</a> and whenever we communicate how to contact us, (e.g. phone numbers/hotlines/webforms or SMS during a crisis) as a means of highlighting how your data is held and processed.</p>

                <p>We may also send an email and/or SMS to all Affected Persons immediately after the Crisis Hub file has been closed for a specific crisis to inform them of this Privacy Notice.</p>

                <h2 id="legal-basis-for-the-processing">
                    <span class="number">4. </span>Legal basis for the processing</h2>

                <p>We process this data because it is necessary to perform our official functions as a government department, so that we can provide British nationals with notarial, documentary, ETD and consular services abroad.</p>

                <p>We also process some of this data because it is necessary to do so in order to comply with our obligations under:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the Consular Marriages and Marriages under Foreign Law (no.2) Order 2014</li>
                    <li>civil Partnership (Registration Abroad and Certificates) Order 2005</li>
                    <li>the Marriage of Same Sex Couples (Conversion of Civil Partnership) Regulations 2014</li>
                    <li>the Registration of Overseas Births and Deaths Regulations 2014</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Site usage data is processed on the basis that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by us – namely the need to improve the service we provide and respond to feedback.</p>

                <h2 id="special-category-and-criminal-data">
                    <span class="number">5. </span>Special category and criminal data</h2>

                <p>In some cases we process what is known as ‘special category data’. This is data that requires extra protection. It includes information about your health, race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation and genetic or biometric data.</p>

                <p>For example, before we can issue registration documents you will be asked for a copy of your passport photo page to verify your identity. Before we can issue an emergency travel document you will also be asked to provide a photograph. This may be done online or at a later point in the process. A photograph used for ID is biometric data. We process this data because it is essential for the FCO to be able to verify your identity and subsequent eligibility for an emergency travel document. The photo will also be printed upon the emergency travel document if one is issued so that the emergency travel document is a valid and restricted travel document for you to use. We are unable to issue an emergency travel document without the provision of this data.</p>

                <p>It is therefore necessary to process it in order to perform our functions as a government department and it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest</p>

                <p>Where we need to process health information, for example because you have fallen ill abroad and we need to help you find appropriate care, we process such data because it is necessary to do so in order to perform our official functions as a government department and because it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest. There may also be cases, such as in an emergency, when it is necessary to process such data in order to protect your vital interests.</p>

                <p>Where a British National is arrested overseas for a serious offence then the FCO is notified of this. In such cases we share this data with ACRO Criminal Records Office (ACRO). ACRO have a legitimate interest in receiving such information because it is necessary for them to have a complete offending history of individuals in order to perform their function of safeguarding the public in the UK against unlawful acts, dishonesty or seriously improper conduct. This includes safeguarding individuals who are particularly at risk such as children as well as vulnerable adults.</p>

                <h2 id="security-of-your-data">
                    <span class="number">6. </span>Security of your data</h2>

                <p>We take data security very seriously and we take every step to ensure that your data remains private and secure.
                    For online services we have procedures and security features in place to keep your data secure once we receive it. We also use SSL in order to encrypt all data transferred to and received from our server.</p>

                <p>In order to register births, deaths and marriages, Overseas Registration Unit may need to verify your data with the Home Office, Her Majesty’s Passport Office and the General Register Office. We will therefore share your data with these organisations in order to do so.</p>

                <h3 id="lost-or-stolen-passports">
                    <span class="number">7.2 </span>Lost or stolen passports</h3>

                <p>Information about lost or stolen passports may be shared with appropriate public and private sector authorities who can assist in locating and recovering the missing passport and to help prevent the passport being used for criminal purposes. In particular we will pass details of lost and stolen passports to Her Majesty’s Passport Office.</p>

                    <span class="number">7.3 </span>Consular assistance services</h3>

                <p>We may need to share your data with foreign authorities (eg local hospitals, prison authorities) in order to ensure you are receiving the support you need. We may for the same reason, share data with foreign authorities in order to provide appropriate consular support, (eg local hospitals, or police/prison authorities). In particular, we may share some of your data with partner organisations that can provide you with information or support that we are unable to provide. This may include organisations such as Prisoners Abroad for detainees, Victim Support for those bereaved by murder or manslaughter, and airport chaplaincies in the UK for those who require assistance upon return to the UK. Wherever possible, we will seek your consent to share your information with these organisations.</p>

                    <li>consular Marriages and Marriages under Foreign Law (no.2) Order 2014</li>

                <p>Where a British National is arrested overseas for a serious offence we share this information with ACRO – see above.</p>
